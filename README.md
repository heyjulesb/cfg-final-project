## File Structure
### __app.py__

### __website/\_\_init\_\_.py__
Defines the setup of the website package - this will be run on execution of the app.py file/instantiation of the app.

### __website/api_helpers.py__
Contains the functions that process the API requests - this includes making GET requests, acquiring authorisation tokens, and returning data to the main program.

### __website/auth.py__
Contains all of the server routes that handle authorsiation internally.

### __website/forms.py__

## Requirements
Before running this code, you will need to have installed several Python packages. If you are using Python's pip, you can do this by executing the following commands:

`pip install Flask`\
`pip install spotipy`\
`pip install Flask-Session`\
`pip install WTForms`\
`pip install Flask-WTF`\
`pip install requests`\
`pip install flask_sqlalchemy`\
`pip install flask-bcrypt`\
`pip install flask-login`

Additionally, you will need to create an api_utils.py file, which should live in the 'website' directory. This should contain the API keys needed to run the app - this will include the getgeoapi.com API, the openweathermap.com API, and Spotify's client ID and client secret. CFG instructors: please message one of the project team to be sent a full set of keys.

## Running the App
In order to run the code, you will need to navigate into the same directory as the app.py file, then execute one of the following commands in your terminal. This will launch the application, give the IP address at which the application is running, and allow you to open the application in your browser.

Using Bash:

```
export FLASK_APP=hello
flask run
```

Using Windows Powershell:
```
$env:FLASK_APP = "hello"
flask run
```

Using Windows CMD:
```
set FLASK_APP=hello
flask run
```

## Using the App
On opening the website, the app will automatically detect your location and the weather in your area. Clicking the "Login to Spotify" button will allow you to link the app with your Spotify account, and will provide you with a suggested playlist of songs relating to your weather. 

You can also create an account with the app, which may grant additional features in the future - for example, the ability to save multiple locations, or to opt in to a "daily digest" summary of the weather in your area with a new playlist for you. We are also hoping to add the ability for Spotify users to assign their own playlists to certain weather conditions.
